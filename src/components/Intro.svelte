      Noise Solution, an NGO based in England, is focused on (re)building
      confidence and self-esteem in individuals, particularly young people, who
      are currently facing significant challenges. They offer a multi-week
      program where participants are mentored by professional musicians to
      create their own music.
    </p>
    <p>
      At both the start and end of the mentorship, participants take the
      Shortened Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), a 7-item test that
      subjectively measures well-being, with scores ranging from 7 (lowest) to
      35 (highest). By comparing the scores from the beginning and end of the
      mentorship, we can measure the positive impact of Noise Solution's
      efforts.
